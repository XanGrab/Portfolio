# Embarking in the Darkness üïØÔ∏è

Heading to the _Bay 12 Games_ website, I downloaded a fresh (and free!) copy of **Dwarf Fortress** (hereafter DF) to my PC. I am teeming with excitement to play DF for the first time. In passing, I have overheard whispers of this game as a developer making me aware of its contributions to the procedural generation and construction-sim space. That said I am familiar with literally nothing else about DF. With my download complete, I double-clicked the executable in my downloads folder and patiently awaited the game's launch.

...

Nothing.

Not a completely uncommon experience as a Linux user, but disappointing nonetheless. I then moved to the terminal and attempted to execute the launch script, revealing a plethora of missing packages on my machine. I rationalize to myself that this is the price I must pay for freedom üêß. A couple of package installs later, I am finally graced with this beautiful launch screen:

(You may have noticed that this screenshot is wider than normal. This is due to the default resolution settings on my ultra-wide monitor... which is going to come back to bite me later).

My initial impressions of starting the game are plagued by my newly wired UX brain noting each little difficulty and attempting to analyze how user-friendly these early menus are. My experience playing games like Minecraft tells me I am to "Create new world", where I am subsequently presented with a new menu of options to create my world.

{{< figure src="./img/basic-settup.png" align="center" caption="New World Menu" >}}

Do I have any idea what these options do? Nope. After briefly clicking detailed mode (thinking perhaps it would explain the details of my options to me) and finding a frightening menagerie of radio buttons and slider options, I decided to trust my gut and make some of the basic selections:

Map size -> Smaller
History Length -> 5 years
Number of Civilizations (What are these?)-> Low
Max Number of Sities (What are those?) -> Low
Number of beasts (Eeek) -> ~~Very low~~ (wait I'm no coward) -> Low
Natural Savagery (Natural what!?) -> Very Low
Mineral Occurrence (I feel like dwarves will want minerals) -> Frequent

{{< figure src="./img/go-back-go-back.png" align="center" caption="For the morbidly curious, this is what I found in detailed mode üò±" >}}

Suddenly, a series of new windows flies by as my world and history are generated before me. As excited as I am, I absorb none of the information it presents to me (hopefully that wasn't too important... üòÅ).

It is now time for me to pick my settlement location... whatever that means. I read some warnings about aquifers being dangerous, and attempted and find a dry piece of land close (but not too close) to another dwarf fortress; dwarves gotta stick together, right?

After some time spent waiting for another few loading menus, I finally arrive at an adorable little ASCII world. After a little trial-and-error, I discover the keyboard and mouse commands to move about the map and begin hovering over different tiles on the map reading the descriptions of each and every little thing I come across. My first observation is that nothing is moving in the world which--after taking a little time to orient myself to my surroundings--I decide is kinda weird.

### Current Objective: Make a thing happen

I click through a "couple" of menus searching for any sort of help or instructions on what I should be doing. I pour myself into learning about expedition parties and try to create a party of my own to no avail. Flipping through menu after menu I am now feeling lost and disoriented as I hyper-fixate on one specific interface for a few minutes before deciding that this isn't where I'm supposed to be (This seems as good a time to mention that I do not play a ton of construction and sim games, though I am loosely familiar with the genre).

A nervous glance at the clock reveals that in an hour and a half, I have not figured out how to do a single thing. üòµ‚Äçüí´

Desperate, I turn to YouTube to find the official dwarf fortress tutorial.

I skipped through to the 6 minute mark searching for the _navigating the play-field_ section, where I discover the concept of DF "pause" and "play" modes of DF, in addition to the charming pixel art of the paid version (note to self, may be worth the $30 price tag at a later date). I skim through a couple more key sections of the tutorial (looking at things, jobs, digging), before closing it and returning to the game. At that moment, I spotted what was evidently supposed to be my indication that the game was paused.

With a press of the spacebar my world sprung to life and I watched tiny little ASCII glyphs dance across the screen.

### Objective Complete: Made a thing happen

The next hour of gameplay seems to fly by as I begin to dig out a modest cavern for my dwarves. As I entered into a zone state, near-completely engrossed in the game, I made note of the following observations by way of quick screen grabs and jotting down a quick scribble on a post-it note. Here are a small selection of some of my most memorable notes:

### Day 1 Memos:

After what started as a grueling battle with an admittedly obtuse interface, I found myself pulling myself away from my computer as I slowly fell in love with the little ASCII world before me. I leave of this week excited to play more next week and strangely a bit nervous that my dwarves will wander off on adventures without me while I'm gone. I find my bizarre desire to anthropomorphize these little glyphs on my screen absolutely fascinating.

I'll leave off with one final note, and perhaps my most proud achievement from my session of play.

{{< figure src="./img/farm-plot-achieved.png" align="center" caption="**_BEHOLD_**üì£ my adorable lil' dwarf farm! üßë‚Äçüåæ">}}

It took me a while to figure out that I could make a plot on the sand, though I consulted my aforementioned guide to learn that I should make my farm underground.
