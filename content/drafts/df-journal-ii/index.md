_This is the second entry in my Dwarf Fortress journal. If you have not read the first one, you can find it [here](../df-journal-i/)_ üëàÔ∏è

> This week, I decided to return from the murky depths of my Dwarf Fortress and get a better sense of my surroundings.

> After blindly stumbling through the early hours of my first play session, I decided that it may be beneficial to explore the DF community and see what tips and tricks it might offer before my next outing.

## Plunging into the Annals of Adams

To begin my research, I decided to learn more about the creators of the game and its lengthy history. This isn't something I would typically do at this point after starting a new game unless I had some particular interest in a particular aspect of the game's development. For me, the fact that **_Dwarf Fortress_** has been in active development for over two decades is a fact that continues to boggle my mind, after spending a measly three years working a fan game part-time. The game is shrouded in mystique and _aura_‚Äîas the kids would say‚Äîwhich comes from its place in gaming history.

To briefly summarize what makes Dwarf Fortress so interesting, the game is well known for its complex world generation (far ahead of its time), intricate simulation mechanics, and a lack of traditional user interface, creating a deeply immersive and challenging experience. It has a profound legacy in the gaming world as one of the most intricate and influential simulation-management games ever created. First released on August 8th, 2006 by Tarn and Zach Adams, the game became infamous for its steep barrier to entry and the depth of its complex world-building. The game helped popularize an entire genre of simulation and management games, influencing titles like "Minecraft" and "RimWorld." One of the game's largest contributions in the space is its development of emergent storylines that present themselves to players not through lengthy walls of text, or scattered item descriptions but within the minds of the players themselves. Despite its simple graphics, Dwarf Fortress is known for the depth of its emergent storytelling, where every action can lead to unexpected, memorable outcomes.

For this task, I turned to YouTube to find some interviews and documentaries on the creation of the game. The following videos helped to provide insight into the minds of the game's creators as well as an abridged history of the game's creation:

## Finding Dwarven Fellows

In addition to learning more about the creation of this game, I chose to join the game's community Discord server of 5000+ fellow players to learn more about what the DF community was saying about the game. In line with the game's lack of tutorialization, there is a dedicated channel focused solely on answering questions about the game (Had I only known sooner). While attempting to avoid any major "spoilers" that might detract from my sense of exploration and discovery, I found the channel to be a wonderful resource for loads of intricate player questions ranging from: _Why are my dwarves doing X?_ to _What are some of the best ways for me to mod DF?_ Seeing this kind of active discourse surrounding a twenty-year-old game, helped bolster my slightly weary spirits knowing that there was an army of dwarves invested in the game's rich ecosystem and ready to lend a hand to their fellow dwarf.

## Kruggsmash

It was through this community that I was exposed to the popular content creator [Kruggsmash](https://www.youtube.com/@kruggsmash) and his six-year-old library of DF-related videos. These videos range from tutorials for newbs(yours trulyÔ∏èüòÅ), to stories woven from the superposition of the game's emergent narrative and the minds of its passionate players.

I found Kruggsmash's tutorials interesting in comparison with the video I had watched on the Kitfox Games YouTube channel.

Kruggsmash's video is a good 5 years older than the former (predating the addition of the game's fancy new graphics) and covers a lot more detail behind the rationale of the same advice I had been given previously. Watching this tutorial made clear Kruggsmash's passion and knowledge of the game speaking with the calmness of a wise old wizard patiently guiding players towards an enjoyable first adventure while attempting to equip them with the tools to discover some of the game's charm for themselves. I found this tutorial to offer far more insight into the game's mechanics and excited me to get back into the game this coming weekend.
