## Me & MOTHER²

My role in the MOTHER² development team is two fold as both a developer and UX designer. I am responsible recreating a number of the games features and additions, as well as the researching and designing improvements focused on player experience.

MOTHER²'s screen resolution has been enlarged to be able to view more of the game world! This was a highly-requested change that we were fortunately able to accommodate. Overworld and battle UI has been adjusted accordingly.

You can buy items from any shop in bulk. A counter will display and allows the player to buy multiple items, assuming you have inventory space and are able to afford them.

🚲 Bikes are back!️ This time all party members are eventually able to use them via a momentum-based system! This works well in conjunction with the running mechanic. As an added bonus, bikes are able to be delivered straight to you by calling Punk-Sure, the bike shop.

Plus, many more returning and new features are in the works... 🎁
