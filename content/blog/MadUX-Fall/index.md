# What does games user research look like, for a fan game?

This is the very question I found myself contemplating at the outset of my user experience capstone program. For those wondering, the [UW‚ÄìMadison User Experience Design](https://ischool.wisc.edu/programs/uxcapstone/) (superbly nicknamed the Mad UX program) provides graduate-level user experience skills in planning, designing, and assessing innovative digital applications and media. As a recent graduate, looking ahead at returning for grad school, this program seemed the perfect way for me to diversify my digital media skills while simultaneously allowing me to get ahead by earning a few credits during my gap year. I had first heard of the term _user experience_ from my mentors at Field Day Learning Games who had talked about their background with user experience as a crucial element of their philosophy as designers.

The Mad UX program emphasizes the practical application of the research methods studied through projects decided by each individual student. For my project, I hoped to tie together an ongoing personal project of mine with my budding user research skills. Speaking to the lead producer of _[MOTHER¬≤]_(insert link) I sought to broaden the scope of my contributions to the project from mere programming and development to more design and user experience aspects of the project. This request was met with cautious acceptance, as the producer seemed interested to see what insights the research might provide for development without any real direction for research studies that could benefit the project. This left me with a lot of creative freedom to shape the research to match the requirements of my program coupled with the burden of fledgling UX maturity from the other members of my team. What could go wrong... üòÅ

As I quickly found out upon entering the program, the requirements of digital games vary quite a bit from traditional digital mediums like apps or websites.

Listing every difference between traditional and games user research is beyond the scope of this case study, but for those curious check out [this talk by Alistair Greo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxZeFJpqlDY) or [this article by Jakob Nielsen](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/game-user-research/).

Suffice it to say, I was gonna need to do some extra homework to help fill in the gaps in my GUR knowledge (a slightly less superb acronym for games user research).

Enter my online oasis:

Written by [Steve Bromley](https://gamesuserresearch.com/about/) this site contains a plethora of resources for newbie games user researchers ranging from expert-written articles and case studies to full-blown UX courses, and online community where you can connect with other games user researchers and Steve himself! I cannot overstate how valuable a resource this website was as I was exploring the world of game user research and highly recommend the Discord community to anyone else looking to explore what GUR has to offer. Steve's articles helped supplement my primary readings for that fall including: _Understanding Your Users: A Practical Guide to User Research Methods_ by Catherine Courage, Kathy Baxter, and Kelly Caine and _Universal Methods of Design_ by Bella Martin and Bruce Hanington.

## Breaking Ground

Putting into practice the research methods studied in the early months of the Mad UX capstone, it was time to conduct some research of my own and get my feet wet. The first decision to be made was to pick an appropriate research method for my team's first study. While there was some consensus amongst long-time team members on the direction of the MOTHER¬≤ project, the open-source nature of the project had led to a lot of turnover, even starting just from the time I had joined the team (about 3 years into development). It seemed to me that taking the time to better solidify _who_ our players are would be most beneficial moving forward.

For this reason, I conducted two studies in order to capture a more detailed snapshot of our current users. The first study was a survey polling player interests and in-game rewards, distributed to the game's current followers on Discord and Twitter (now X). In addition, we elected to conduct virtual interviews with some of our target audience members. The MOTHER¬≤ team has periodically invited playtesters to help QA test early alpha versions of the game, who turned out to be a wonderful candidate pool when selecting potential players for interviews.

From these studies, I was able to collect over 300 responses and conduct 7 sem-moderated interviews which generated a ton of raw data that I was then able to record and transform into deliverables for my team. These deliverables included a competitor set of similar EarthBound remake titles, a catalog of games our players were most familiar with, some demographic info for our target audience, and poll results for our followers' favorite types of in-game rewards and bonus challenges. As hoped, sharing this information with my team, helped to give clarity to our design discussions around our potential users and bought me a little more buy-in to continue my user research within the project. And indeed, there was plenty more to be done. In preparation for our Beta launch, this research experiment helped reveal the potential for additional playtests and observational studies to be conducted to better understand what draws fans to our project.
