## I am a lifelong, self-driven learner and problem solver

I have been professionally developing games for the last two years, and recreationally my entire life. I graduated the University of Wisconsinâ€”Madison with a Bachelors in Computer Science and three certificates in Game Design, Digital Art, and Professional Japanese Comunication.

I am proficient in a diverse range of full-stack toolchains targeting game and web development. I am frequently found in international fan games, hackathons, and game jams, expressing my passion for applied games and FOSS.

I achieved the rank of Eagle Scout before graduating high school and continued developing my leadership skills guiding competitive e-sports teams to compete at the national level and igniting passion in STEM teaching kids ages K-12.
