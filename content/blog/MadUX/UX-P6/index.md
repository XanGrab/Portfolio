## UX + Game Development

Usability studies in UX design are fundamentally about understanding how users interact with a product, identifying pain points, and iterating on design to enhance user experience. In game development, playtesting serves a similar function but is focused on ensuring that players not only understand and enjoy the game but are also engaged and challenged in the right ways. The methodologies of usability studies translate well into playtesting because both fields prioritize user-centered design. They involve observing real users (or players) interacting with a product (or game) and gathering data to inform design decisions.

In this report, usability principles were applied to understand how players experienced the introductory sequence of EarthBound. Observing where players struggled, what confused them, and what they found engaging provided valuable insights that can guide the development of the MOTHER¬≤ remake. Just as in traditional UX, the goal in game development is to create an intuitive, enjoyable experience that aligns with users' expectations while also challenging them in meaningful ways.

## Cancellations

One of the challenges mentioned in the report was the cancellation of two participants who were unable to complete their playtesting sessions due to scheduling conflicts. This kind of setback is common in both usability studies and playtesting, where participation relies heavily on the availability and commitment of volunteers. Dealing with such cancellations requires flexibility and a willingness to adapt the study design as needed. In this case, the study focus was shifted entirely to participants unfamiliar with EarthBound, which allowed the research to continue without compromising the integrity of the findings. However, the loss of veteran players from the study meant that certain insights, particularly those related to experienced players' expectations and challenges, were not captured.

Going forward, it might be beneficial to have a backup plan for participant cancellations, such as over-recruiting slightly to account for no-shows or having a secondary pool of participants on standby. Additionally, considering the possibility of rescheduling sessions or conducting additional studies later could help mitigate the impact of cancellations on research outcomes.

## Troubleshooting AV Issues in Parsec

The report also highlighted the technical challenges faced during the playtesting sessions, particularly related to the use of Parsec for remote gameplay. Parsec is a powerful tool for streaming games, allowing users to connect to a host machine and play games remotely, but it comes with its own set of challenges, especially concerning audio and visual quality.

Troubleshooting these issues is crucial for ensuring a smooth playtesting experience. Poor audio or video quality can distract participants and potentially skew the results of the study. For example, if a player struggles to hear instructions or if the video lags during a crucial moment, their gameplay experience‚Äîand thus the data collected‚Äîmay not accurately reflect their true capabilities or opinions.

In future studies, it's important to allocate time before each session for troubleshooting these technical issues. This could involve checking the participant's internet connection, adjusting Parsec settings for optimal performance, and ensuring that the host machine is equipped to handle the demands of streaming the game. Additionally, having a technical support plan in place during the session can help quickly resolve any issues that arise, minimizing disruptions to the playtesting process.

## Playtesting with Developers

Another interesting observation from the report was that participants with development experience often wanted to propose changes to the game during the playtesting sessions. This is a common occurrence in both usability studies and playtesting when working with participants who have a background in design or development. Their familiarity with the process can lead them to offer suggestions or critiques beyond the scope of the study.

While these insights can be valuable, it's important to remember that the primary goal of playtesting is to observe how players interact with the game as it currently exists, not to gather design feedback. Therefore, moderators need to strike a balance between acknowledging these suggestions and keeping the session focused on the tasks at hand.

One way to manage this is to set clear expectations at the beginning of the session. Participants should be encouraged to share their thoughts and experiences, but they should also understand that the purpose of the session is to observe their interaction with the game, not to brainstorm design changes. If participants do offer suggestions, these can be noted separately for consideration by the development team later, without letting them derail the session's focus.

### Conclusion

Reflecting on the usability playtest report, it's clear that the principles of UX usability studies translate effectively into the realm of game development playtesting. Both fields share a common goal of creating user-centered experiences, and both face similar challenges, such as dealing with participant cancellations and technical issues. Additionally, managing participants' expectations and keeping sessions focused are crucial for collecting valuable data.

The insights gained from this study will be instrumental in guiding the development of MOTHER¬≤, ensuring that the remake retains the charm and appeal of the original EarthBound while addressing the challenges identified through playtesting. As the development process continues, the lessons learned from this playtest will be invaluable in refining the game's design and ensuring that it meets the expectations of both new and veteran players alike.
