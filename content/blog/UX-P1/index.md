## Mad UX

The [UW–Madison User Experience Design](https://ischool.wisc.edu/programs/uxcapstone/) capstone certificate provides graduate-level user experience skills in planning, designing, and assessing innovative digital user experiences via digital applications and media.

Completing this capstone has been a year-long endeavor for me as I continue to build my portfolio in preparation for graduate school and beyond. After completing our introductory training in user research methods, prototyping, and visual design, my cohort and I began preparations for the final stretch of our program by outlining research goals for a digital application distinct from our previous terms. In conjunction with the _[MOTHER²](../../games/MotherSquared/)_ development team, I sought to continue my research from earlier semesters by studying the player experience of the original SNES title _EarthBound_.

The choice to conduct research on an SNES title from the '90s may initially seem a bit odd; what value can be gleaned from studying a game published three decades ago? The research conducted this summer serves to bolster my skills in evaluating and researching the user experience of digital games as well as common data collection and analysis methods used in the field today.

## A1: Research Goals

In order to develop actionable insights into player behavior, careful research planning was conducted to draft a research proposal describing the game to be tested, its players, their goals, and potential research questions. As a user researcher, our goals are of course centered on the player and their experiences with the game. That said understanding the goals of our stakeholders, and the larger context of our product, helps us to focus our research on providing insights that hold more value to all members of the team. This helps ensure that the results of our research are not ignored or wasted, as well as fostering buy-in from developers and stakeholders alike.

As the development team of MOTHER² is comprised entirely of fans of the original _EarthBound_, this presents a unique opportunity for insights into fan-lead projects of this scope. Fan games and ROM hacks seldom undertake a complete remaking of their source of inspiration, which involves the coordinating multiple fans over multiple years into a microcosm of a modern game development pipeline. Within the user experience domain, this creates an uncommon scenario in which users have become producers seeking to improve upon the experiences of the game. This brings with it, a chance to study the unique perspectives and biases of the development team in addition to studying perspective players in our target audience.

## A2: Metrics Exploration

In preparation for our upcoming research studies, we developed a greater understanding of performance metrics based on task completion, error rate, efficiency, and learnability. Particular attention was dedicated to the task analysis process, detailing the presentation, collection, and categorization of task data. Subsequently, we employed some elementary statistical analysis on sample data to practice these skills in spreadsheet editing software.
