## I am a lifelong, self-driven learner and problem solver

👤 I have been professionally developing games for the last two years, and recreationally my entire life. I graduated from the University of Wisconsin—Madison with a bachelor's degree in computer science and three certificates (minors) in game design, digital art, and professional Japanese communication. 

🧑‍💻 I am proficient in various full-stack toolchains targeting game and web development. I am frequently found in international fan games, hackathons, and game jams, expressing my passion for applied games and FOSS.

🎓 I was recently a developer at Field Day Learning Games where I worked on titles such as [Wake: Tales from the Aqualab](../games/wake). Last year I completed a graduate certificate capstone in [User Experience Design](../blog/madux) at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. I also worked part-time at Maydm Inc, a non-profit here in Madison providing girls and youth of color in grades 6 -12 with the skills, experiences, and connections to pursue careers in STEM. I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Design, Informal, and Creative Education exploring the use of new technologies and media in the service of learning and human growth.
