## I am a lifelong, self-driven learner and problem solver

👤 I have began creating games since I was in middle-school, and in a professional capacity since 2022. I graduated from the University of Wisconsin—Madison with a bachelor's degree in computer science and certificates (minors) in game design, digital art, and Japanese communication. Afterward, I returned to complete a year-long capstone certificate in user experience design, which you can learn more about [here](../blog/madux). I am currently pursuing a master's degree of science in [Design, Informal, and Creative Education](https://ci.education.wisc.edu/research/digital-media/) exploring the use of new technologies and media in the service of learning and human growth.

🧑‍💻 I have a diverse range of experience developing games and tutoring others on their journey in game development. Recently I was a developer at Field Day Learning Games where I worked [Wake: Tales from the Aqualab](../games/wake) and among other projects. I am proficient in various full-stack toolchains targeting game and web development. I am frequently found in international fan games, hackathons, and game jams, expressing my passion for applied games and FOSS.

🎓 Throughout my education, it has always been important for me to give some of that knowledge back to my community. I have taught in various capacities both formal and informal as a game development instructor at [Maydm Inc](https://www.maydm.org/) and [Code Ninjas](https://www.codeninjas.com/), as an e-sports coach with [XPLeague](https://www.xpleague.com/), and a software trainer within UW—Madison's [DoIT Academic Technology](https://sts.doit.wisc.edu/).
