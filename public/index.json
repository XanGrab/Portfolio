I’m Xander\nI am a lifelong, self-driven learner and problem solver 👤 I have began creating games since I was in middle-school, and in a professional capacity since 2022. I graduated from the University of Wisconsin—Madison with a bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degree in computer science and certificates (minors) in game design, digital art, and Japanese communication. Afterward, I returned to complete a year-long capstone certificate in user experience design, which you can learn more about here. I am currently pursuing a master\u0026rsquo;s degree of science in Design, Informal, and Creative Education exploring the use of new technologies and media in the service of learning and human growth.\n🧑‍💻 I have a diverse range of experience developing games and tutoring others on their journey in game development. Recently I was a developer at Field Day Learning Games where I worked Wake: Tales from the Aqualab and among other projects. I am proficient in various full-stack toolchains targeting game and web development. I am frequently found in international fan games, hackathons, and game jams, expressing my passion for applied games and FOSS.\n🎓 Throughout my education, it has always been important for me to give some of that knowledge back to my community. I have taught in various capacities both formal and informal as a game development instructor at Maydm Inc and Code Ninjas, as an e-sports coach with XPLeague, and a software trainer within UW—Madison\u0026rsquo;s DoIT Academic Technology.\n💾 Learn more about my projects in the Games tab up above!\nCome chat more with me about about your favorite story or game 👉📪\n","permalink":"/whoami/","summary":"Learn more about who I am and what I am about! 😊","title":"whoami"}]
